# AI
In one of my Data Science classes, I learned some generic algorithms used in data mining. These python applications are my exploration into those algorithms.  As I learn more about data mining and AI, I may expand these applications.  

apriori.py
==========
This follows the generic apriori algorithm to determine patterns within lists.  For example, given numerous shopping lists, it may discover that people who purchase peanut butter and jelly also tend to purchase bread.  This program is run from the command line and uses a menu interface for manual data entry and to display results.  It is intended as a basic demonstration, or to work through small, simplified examples.

tree_node.py 
============
This calculates the information gained from a table of categorized items. This measure can be used to determine which split will provide the highest ability to predict an outcome. A sample table (test_class_2.csv), predicting whether a person will purchase a computer, is included in this repository. This program is run from the command line and uses a menu interface. It accepts either csv or manual input and displays the results on the screen.  It is intended as a basic demonstration, or to work through small, simplified examples.  This program only performs a single calculation, and will not build a tree or structure.
